StockBot
=========

This is an application that takes user inputs in real language and puts them into an equity valuation model to generate customized stock prices for the user.  It aims to make it easier for average investors to generate their own stock values by taking care of the more sophisticated parts of economic calculation for them.

Tasks to complete:

- [ ] Add more valuation methods using comparables

- [ ] Add backup values from other APIs

- [ ] Use another API for stock-prices

- [ ] Change existing questions to jquery using AlloyUI 

- [ ] Make defaults for values that take into account decimals and significant digits

- [ ] Create an API

- [ ] Insert redirect screens between the index & picker as well as the picker & result pages

- [ ] Use a regression (statsample gem) on the stock sentiment data

- [ ] Use machine learning to adjust the weights on the ValueGenerator model

- [ ] Add a proper sidebar with tabs for Stockbot stuff, Company stuff, and the API
